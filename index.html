<p>You've stumbled upon my little corner of the web. Welcome! I'm going to proceed with writing this in the third person because I think it adds a little more gravitas to the persona, no?</p>
<p>Alex Vaccaro is a <a href="https://github.com/vyttieri" target="_blank">software developer</a> based out of Los Angeles, California. He was educated at the illustrious Stanford University, where the frenetic energy of Silicon Valley threatened to swallow him whole, but also imbued him with the drive to better the world through better technology. His software career has been primarily in the realm of web development, although he has <a href="/resume/">worn many different hats</a>.</p>
<p>He spent some time making a career switch in the medical field - working in psychiatric nursing and as a pre-medical student. The realities of living in a world with a pandemic drove him to return to his roots as an engineer, but he took away a very humanist perspective.</p>
<p>Recently, Alex has been focusing his time on honing his Ruby craft, as well as learning the art of <a href="/viz/">data visualization</a>, believing that one key to equity and equality is the communication of complex ideas in simple ways.</p>
<p>Alex's other hobbies include music, rock climbing, backpacking, board games, literature, and film. Alex is somewhat obssessed with the data of his personal life - Just how many hours have we spent watching TV? Playing games?</p>
<p>Alex is always looking for collaborators to spark new ideas and creations. <a href="mailto:alexandervaccaro@gmail.com">Drop him a line!</a></p>
